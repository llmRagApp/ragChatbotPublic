      "So, why even talk about\n",
      "unstructured data 10\n",
      "Because it is so common 5\n",
      "Most estimates place unstructured data as\n",
      "80-90% of the world's data 17\n",
      "This data exists in many forms and, for the most part, goes\n",
      "unnoticed by humans as a potential source of data 25\n",
      "Tweets, emails, literature, and server\n",

      "We may do this by applying\n",
      "new characteristics that describe the data 13\n",
      "A few such characteristics are as follows:\n",
      "Word/phrase count\n",
      "The existence of certain special characters\n",
      "The relative length of text\n",

      "\n",
      "More than requiring a certain type of data, pre-processing allows us to explore features that\n",

      "Because it is so common 5\n",
      "Most estimates place unstructured data as\n",
